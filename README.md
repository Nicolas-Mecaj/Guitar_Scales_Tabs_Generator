# Guitar_Scales_Tabs_Generator
The Guitar Scales Tabs Generator is a Python script developed as my final project for CS50P. This project is designed to assist guitar enthusiasts and learners in visualizing and exploring various musical scales. It generates both frets' and notes' tablatures for a specified musical scale and root key.
